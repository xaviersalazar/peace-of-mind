      Bésame Cosmetics was founded in 2004 out of a fascination with art,
      history, and beauty; a vintage makeup brand which honors the style,
      spirit, and sensibility of female beauty. Through a keen eye for color and
      historical expertise, Besame recreates modern reproductions of classic
      luxury makeup from the 1920s, ‘30s, ‘40s, and ‘50s, designed to make women
      feel elegant, inspired, and empowered by their beauty. Pairing innovative,
      cutting edge technology with a historical milieu, Besame's colors and
      formulations are painstakingly hand-crafted to a minutia of detail, from
      there custom-designed gold compacts to there signature chrysanthemum
      motifs. Based in Southern California, Bésame understands Hollywood’s
      ongoing fascination with the vintage aesthetic, and often helps production
      designers recreate accurate makeup displays for period film and television
      (catch a glimpse of our Crimson Rouge tin in the 2012’s Academy
      Award-winning film, “The Artist”).
