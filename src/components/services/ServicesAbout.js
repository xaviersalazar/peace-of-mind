      to give attention to, in order to take care of our bodies, we only get one
      body. Everyone experiences stress from everyday living, we feel tension
      laced throughout or muscles sometimes accompanied by aches and pain from
      old accidents, medical conditions, and repetitive hard work we put our
      bodies thought daily. No matter what your occupation is working too long

      Human touch increases the production of endorphins, growth hormone, along
      with DHEA, all of which lengthen your life span and lower the negative
      impact of stress. Studies have found that patients who are regularly
      touched recover faster than those who are not touched. So get a massage
      and feel your mood improve.
