        Why should you get a massage?
      </p>
      <Text>
        We all have stress, tension, aches and pains that we experience and need
        to give attention to, in order to take care of our bodies, we only get
        one body. Everyone experiences stress from everyday living, we feel
        tension laced throughout or muscles sometimes accompanied by aches and
        pain from old accidents, medical conditions, and repetitive hard work we
        put our bodies thought daily. No matter what your occupation is working
        too long without a break creates tension in your back, shoulders, and
        neck muscles, tired eyes , and slower,more easily irritated mental
        process.

        Human touch increases the production of endorphins, growth hormone,
        along with DHEA, all of which lengthen your life span and lower the
        negative impact of stress. Studies have found that patients who are
        regularly touched recover faster than those who are not touched. So get
        a massage and feel your mood improve.
